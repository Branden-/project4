Argument descriptions

    -[argument1]
    -a Use an AVL Tree
    -b Use an Unbalanced BST to implement the DataCounter
    -h Use a Hashtable

    -[argument2]
    -frequency  Print all the word/frequency pairs, ordered by frequency,
                and then by words in lexicographic order
    -num_unique Print the number of unique words in the document. This
                is the total number of distinct (different) words in
                the document. Words that appear more than once are only
                counted as a single word for this statistic.

    -[argument3]
    -is use insertion sort
    -qs use quicksort
    -ms use merge sort

Example:
    java WordCount -b -frequency -qs sometextFile.txt

What is happening in the example:
    Runs WordCount program using an unbalanced binary search tree data
    structure and will print out the frequency of the words in lexicographic
    order. The program will use quicksort. The program will perform the
    operations using text from the sometextFile.txt text file.
